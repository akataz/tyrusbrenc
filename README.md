Tyrus Brenc's Personal Website

Front-End Heavy Personal Website

Plan of Attack:
-Free Html template to save time
  -modify to suit front end tech stack

Front end
  -React, MobX, react-router, html, sass
    -will need react, react-router, sass precompiler, mobX

Back end
  -Node, express

Database
  -MongoDB is probably overkill, since it's a single user application
  -SQlite- with sequelize

//New idea for back end is to remove it- enabling hosting on github pages


Splash page should contain picture of me
  -links to LinkedIn, Angellist, blog, email, cool stock background image
  -personal extension down the road? private

React Component Breakdown
-prob a nav bar Component
